Sorry! I had to make a new one because I think we messed up our database with the models. I tried to upload as a separate branch on yours but it wouldn't let me. So I figured I could share the code with you this way and either we delete the old project and you can re-create it :( I'm just trying to keep all the file names the same so there won't be much to change if we do decide to do that. 

I didn't get a chance to have the "+" sign add a task instead of going to the forms page. I got stuck formatting the meals page and I know it's just somewhere in my formatting so that each section can havwe a new form, but I can't figure it out right now!
I think I got the calendar to work.. but going to try to deploy right now so I can view it. When I googled it, it said I wouldn't be able to see if the calendar unless it's on the web.
